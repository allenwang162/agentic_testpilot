# :hatching_chick: Agentic TestPilot for UI

### :computer: **Overview**

**Agentic TestPilot for UI** is an intelligent, autonomous QA agent designed to transform how Quality Engineers validate user interfaces. Powered by OpenAI's advanced LLM integration, this system autonomously interprets test requirements, generates executable test cases, runs validations, and reports results—completely hands-free.

This isn’t just automation. This is autonomy.

### :key: **Problem It Solves**

Manual UI test creation is time-intensive, repetitive, and difficult to scale across fast-moving projects. Even with modern tools, QAs are burdened with translating requirements into code, which slows innovation and increases missed scenarios.

### :anchor: **Solution**

**Agentic TestPilot for UI** introduces a fully autonomous test agent that:

1. **Understands** test requirements using OpenAI's GenAI.
2. **Generates** test scripts using pre-built logic and dynamic templates.
3. **Executes** test cases with real-time validations.
4. **Reports** results directly back via contextual feedback.

### :loudspeaker: **Workflow**

1. **Fetch Testing Requirement** – Agent pulls testing case requirements from predefined sources.
2. **Generate Test Case** – Sends requirements to OpenAI LLM and receives structured test cases.
3. **Create Test Case** – Stores the test cases in `tests/test_ui.py`.
4. **Execute Tests** – Automatically runs the test runner and captures results.
5. **Update Result** – Posts result summaries and metadata back to the relevant source.

### :iphone: **Tech Stack**

- **LLM Integration**: OpenAI
- **Test Generation Logic**: Python + Custom Template Engine
- **UI Test Execution**: Selenium / Playwright / Pytest
- **Feedback Loop**: DevOps Story/Postback API / Teams
- **Agentic Orchestration**: LangChain / LangGraph (coming soon)

### :bell: **Why It’s Unique**

- **Truly Agentic**: No manual scripting or intervention—entire pipeline is autonomous.
- **Live Traceability**: Results are traceable to requirements, enabling rapid feedback.
- **Plug-n-Play**: Easily integrates with existing testing frameworks and workflows.
- **Scalable**: Supports continuous testing pipelines, adaptable to large UI projects.
